This repository showcases a collection of classic control automation projects created using CADe SIMU, a lightweight and easy-to-use simulation software. These projects cover a variety of essential industrial control scenarios and prioritize safety, efficiency, and clarity.

Key highlights include:

🔄 Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) with prioritized power source selection, emergency stop, circuit breakers, and LED indicators for real-time status.

⚙️ Bidirectional Star-Delta Motor Control without braking: includes delay logic for safe direction change, overload protection, and both mechanical/electrical interlocks.

🚦 Simple Traffic Light Control with timed transitions, circuit breaker, and emergency stop functionality.

🟢 Single-Button Motor Control: toggle a motor on/off with a single push button, featuring overload protection and safety shutdown.

🔁 Sequential Motor Programming: the second motor only runs when the first is on, ensuring proper operational order and safety.

⚡ Phase Failure Protection using relays to detect missing phases and shut down the circuit, protecting equipment with LED monitoring and safety features.

🔥 Motor Overload Startup Management: uses a parallel bypass conductor to temporarily reduce startup current and prevent false overload trips.

Each project comes with ready-to-use CADe SIMU files, making this repo perfect for students, automation beginners, and educators who want to simulate and learn real-world control logic without needing complex hardware.
